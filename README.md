# PigLatinBlazor

This application was built using Blazor on VS Studio. For the demonstration, the repo is put into Azure DevOps, the pipeline is built in Azure DevOps, and the environment to deploy to was created in Azure. There currently isn't an IaC, so you'll need to setup your AzureDevops repo and configure the pipeline, and then associate the deployment to your Azure infrastructure (see Pipeline.yaml deploy stage for more information).
